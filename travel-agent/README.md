# AI Travel Assistant with MCP - n8n Workflow Setup

This n8n workflow creates an intelligent travel planning assistant that helps users find flights, hotels, and activities, then automatically generates email summaries and calendar events. It uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced functionality.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Natural conversation for trip planning
- **Multi-Service Search:** Flights, hotels, and activities via SerpAPI
- **Email Generation:** Automated HTML email summaries
- **Calendar Integration:** Automatic event creation with conflict detection
- **Budget Awareness:** Helps users stay within budget constraints
- **Memory:** Remembers conversation context

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up this workflow, you'll need:

- n8n Instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- **API Keys & Credentials:**
  - OpenAI API key
  - SerpAPI key

## 🛠️ Required Credentials Setup

### 1. OpenAI API
- Go to OpenAI Platform
- Create an API key
- In n8n, add OpenAI credentials with your API key

### 2. SerpAPI
- Sign up at SerpAPI
- Get your API key from the dashboard
- Add SerpAPI credentials in n8n

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Import the Workflow
- Copy the provided JSON workflow
- In n8n, go to Workflows > Import from JSON
- Paste the JSON and click Import

### Step 2: Configure Credentials
Update the following credential references in the workflow:
- **OpenAI Chat Model node:** Link your OpenAI API credentials
- **Search Flights/Hotels/Activities nodes:** Link your SerpAPI credentials
- **SendEmail node:** Link your Gmail OAuth2 credentials
- **CreateEvent/GetEvent/DeleteEvent nodes:** Link your Google Calendar OAuth2 credentials

### Step 3: Update MCP Server Endpoints
The workflow uses three MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. You'll need to update the SSE endpoints in the MCP Client nodes:
- **Search MCP Client:** Update the `sseEndpoint` URL
- **Email MCP Client:** Update the `sseEndpoint` URL
- **Calendar MCP Client:** Update the `sseEndpoint` URL

> **Note:** These endpoints should point to your n8n instance's MCP server URLs. The format is typically:  
> `https://your-n8n-instance.com/mcp/[webhook-id]/sse`

### Step 4: Configure MCP Server Tools
The workflow includes three MCP server sections:

- **Search MCP Server:**
  - Search Flights: Uses SerpAPI Google Flights engine
  - Search Hotels: Uses SerpAPI Google Hotels engine
  - Search Activities: Uses SerpAPI general search

- **Email MCP Server:**
  - SendEmail: Gmail tool for sending HTML travel summaries

- **Calendar MCP Server:**
  - CreateEvent: Creates calendar events for travel items
  - GetEvent: Retrieves existing events to check for conflicts
  - DeleteEvent: Removes outdated events when itinerary changes

# Airbnb n8n Workflow

This folder contains the **Airbnb Search Automation Workflow** for n8n.

## Overview
This workflow automates the process of searching Airbnb listings based on user queries submitted from the frontend app. It leverages AI and the MCP Client to fetch, process, and email personalized Airbnb recommendations.

### Key Features
- Receives search requests via webhook from the frontend
- Uses AI (OpenAI) to interpret and enrich user queries
- Connects to the Airbnb MCP tool for real-time listing data
- Parses and formats results for email delivery
- Sends a detailed, styled email with recommendations to the user

## How It Works
1. **User submits a search** (location, dates, guests, etc.) via the frontend form.
2. **Frontend calls the n8n webhook** (`/webhook/2586fd7a-0113-4719-8038-9b59cbcea6e0`) with the query, email, and name.
3. **Workflow processes the request:**
   - AI agent interprets the query and fetches listings using the MCP Client.
   - Results are parsed and formatted.
   - An email is sent to the user with the best Airbnb options.

## Inputs
- `query`: Description of the desired Airbnb stay (location, features, dates, etc.)
- `email`: User's email address (for results delivery)
- `name`: User's name

## Outputs
- Sends a personalized email with Airbnb listings and recommendations to the user.

## Setup
1. Import `airbnb_agent.json` into your n8n instance.
2. Configure credentials for:
   - OpenAI (for AI agent)
   - MCP Client (STDIO)
   - Gmail (for email delivery)
3. Deploy the workflow and copy the webhook URL to your frontend.

## Integration with Frontend
- The frontend app in `chrono-voyage-ai` is pre-configured to send requests to this workflow's webhook.
- Make sure the webhook URL matches in both places.

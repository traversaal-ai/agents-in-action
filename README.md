# Agents in Action
🚀 **Build AI Agents Like a Pro!**

Welcome to my course on AI Agents.

This course is one of the top-rated courses on building AI Agents using no-code/low-code tools. So far, I’ve taught this course to over 1500 professionals, at MAVEN, Stanford Continuing Studies, UCLA and University of Minnesota, helping them gain a deep understanding of the levels of agentic architecture, enterprise-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and open source agentic products deployment.

Unlike most courses, this course teaches you how to think about solving real-world problems using agentic AI combined with no-code tools and enabling you to design, build, and deploy your own custom AI products and solutions.

5. **Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for document-aware chatbots and knowledge-driven agents.
6. **Add long-term memory and context retention to AI workflows** using databases like Supabase for personalization and persistence.
7. **Integrate voice, UI, and API tools** to create multimodal, interactive AI experiences that go beyond text-based interaction.
8. **Automate real-world processes** (e.g., lead generation, content publishing, research synthesis) with AI-human collaboration loops.
9. **Build and evaluate advanced agentic** systems that combine reasoning loops, internet search, and multi-tool orchestration.
10. **Create a meta-agent that builds other agents**, gaining the ability to auto-generate, configure, and deploy intelligent workflows from within n8n itself.

![Agents in Action](images/agents-in-action-banner.png)

### 👋 Welcome to our course on AI Agents. 

This course is one of the top-rated courses on building AI Agents using no-code/low-code tools. So far, we’ve taught this course to over 1500 professionals, at MAVEN, Stanford Continuing Studies, UCLA and University of Minnesota, helping them gain a deep understanding of the levels of agentic architecture, enterprise-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and open source agentic products deployment.

Unlike most courses, this course teaches you how to think about solving real-world problems using agentic AI combined with no-code tools and enabling you to design, build, and deploy your own custom AI products and solutions.

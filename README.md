### 👋 Welcome to my course on AI Agents. 

This course is one of the top-rated courses on building AI Agents using no-code/low-code tools. So far, I’ve taught this course to over 1500 professionals, at MAVEN, Stanford Continuing Studies, UCLA and University of Minnesota, helping them gain a deep understanding of the levels of agentic architecture, enterprise-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and open source agentic products deployment.

Unlike most courses, this course teaches you how to think about solving real-world problems using agentic AI combined with no-code tools and enabling you to design, build, and deploy your own custom AI products and solutions.

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this series, you will be able to:
1. **Understand the evolution of AI agents** — from Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomous, tool-using systems capable of reasoning, memory, and planning.
2. **Master n8n as a no-code AI automation platform**, learning to build, connect, and orchestrate intelligent workflows visually.
3. **Use webhooks to connect frontends and backends**, enabling real-time, two-way communication between users and AI systems.
4. **Design and deploy full-stack AI agents for real-world applications** — including chatbots, sales assistants, research tools, and content automation systems.
5. **Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for document-aware chatbots and knowledge-driven agents.
6. **Add long-term memory and context retention to AI workflows** using databases like Supabase for personalization and persistence.
7. **Integrate voice, UI, and API tools** to create multimodal, interactive AI experiences that go beyond text-based interaction.
8. **Automate real-world processes** (e.g., lead generation, content publishing, research synthesis) with AI-human collaboration loops.
9. **Build and evaluate advanced agentic systems** that combine reasoning loops, internet search, and multi-tool orchestration.
10. **Create a meta-agent that builds other agents**, gaining the ability to auto-generate, configure, and deploy intelligent workflows from within n8n itself.

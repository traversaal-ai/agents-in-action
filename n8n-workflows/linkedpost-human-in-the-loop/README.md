# ✍️ LinkedIn Post Human-in-the-Loop Agent
This folder contains workflows and configurations for **semi-automated LinkedIn post generation and publishing** using n8n and AI.

---

## ✨ Overview
The LinkedIn Post Human-in-the-Loop Agent automates the creation of high-quality, technically-focused LinkedIn posts. Unlike fully automated agents, this workflow introduces a human approval and editing loop to ensure that the tone, accuracy, and style match your brand and professional standards.

It continuously gathers articles from AI news feeds, selects the most relevant deep technical content, drafts LinkedIn posts targeted at AI practitioners and developers, and then requests manual review/approval before posting.

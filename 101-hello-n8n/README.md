# 💬 Hello n8n — Your First AI Workflow in n8n

This folder contains the **“Hello World” AI Workflow** for n8n — now updated to use **OpenRouter** instead of OpenAI.
It’s the simplest way to see how n8n can connect to a free or low-cost AI model and respond to your messages.

---

## ✨ Overview

This workflow demonstrates how a **chat message** can trigger an n8n workflow that talks to an **AI model via OpenRouter** and shows how prompt wording changes the response.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 💬 **Chat Trigger** — starts when you send a message in n8n chat.
- 🧠 **AI Agent** — the “brain” that follows simple communication rules.
- 🤖 **OpenRouter Model** — generates replies using the `deepseek/deepseek-chat` model.
- 🗂️ **Memory** — keeps short-term context for smoother, natural conversation flow.

    A["💬 Chat Trigger"] --> B["🧠 AI Agent"]
    B --> C["🤖 OpenRouter Model (deepseek/deepseek-chat)"]
    B --> D["🗂️ Memory Buffer"]
    C --> B
    D --> B
```

1. 💬 You send a message in n8n’s built-in Chat view.
2. 🧠 The **AI Agent** applies short, clear response rules.
3. 🤖 **OpenRouter**’s `deepseek/deepseek-chat` model generates a reply.
4. 🗂️ **Memory** retains recent chat turns so it feels continuous.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. 🗃️ Import **`101_hello_n8n.json`** into your **n8n Cloud** or self-hosted workspace.
2. 🔑 Create an **OpenRouter API key** (free tier available) → [https://openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
3. In **n8n Credentials** available at [https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN/home/credentials](https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN/home/credentials) add:

   - **Credential Type:** `OpenRouter API`
   - **API Key:** paste your key

4. 🚀 Open the **Chat view** in n8n, and start typing to talk to your workflow.

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 💬 **Chat Trigger**          | Starts when a message is received in n8n chat | No external trigger needed                        |
| 🧠 **AI Agent**              | Applies demo rules: short, simple, clear      | Highlights how prompt specificity changes answers |
| 🤖 **OpenRouter Chat Model** | Uses `deepseek/deepseek-chat`                 | Fast, inexpensive, OpenAI-compatible              |
| 🗂️ **Simple Memory**         | Keeps short conversation history              | Makes chat flow naturally                         |

## 📝 Try It Yourself

Type these messages in chat and compare how the AI adjusts:

- `Tell me about Paris`
- `Tell me about Paris as a foodie`
- `I have eggs and rice`

👉 Notice how the **specificity** of your prompt changes the **depth and tone** of the response.
👉 This is the foundation of understanding how **prompt engineering** affects output.

## 💡 Why OpenRouter?

OpenRouter is an open gateway that lets you access multiple AI models (like Anthropic, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.) with a single API key.

**Benefits:**

- 🪙 Often free or cheaper per request
- 🔄 OpenAI-compatible API (drop-in replacement)
- 🧩 Works with n8n’s existing AI Agent node out of the box

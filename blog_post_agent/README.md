# ✍️ Blog Post Agent

This folder contains workflows and configurations for automated blog post generation using n8n and AI.

---

## ✨ Overview
The Blog Post Agent automates the process of generating high-quality blog posts. It leverages 🤖 AI to create content based on your prompts and can be extended with additional research and enrichment steps.

### 🚀 Key Features
- 📝 Automated blog post generation using AI
- 🗂️ Configurable prompts and topics
- 🔗 Can be integrated with other tools (Google Sheets, Notion, etc.)

---

## 🧩 Sub-Workflow Requirement
**To enable deep research and richer content, you should also add the `scrape link` and `deep research` workflows as sub-workflows.**
- 🛠️ The `scrape_link.json` file extracts and summarizes the content from a link. 
- 🧠 The `blog_deep_research.json` file provides a research pipeline that can be called from the main blog post generator workflow.
- 📚 This allows the agent to gather and synthesize information before drafting the post.

## ⚙️ Setup
1. 📥 Import `blog_post_generator.json` into your n8n instance as the main workflow.
2. 🧠 Import `blog_deep_research.json` as a sub-workflow.
3. 🛠️ Import `scrape_link.json` as a sub-workflow.
4. 🔑 Configure any required credentials (OpenAI, Google, etc.) in n8n.
5. 🛠️ Adjust prompts and workflow logic as needed for your use case.

## 🚦 Usage
- ▶️ Trigger the main workflow with your desired topic or prompt.
- 🔄 The workflow will call the scrape link and deep research sub-workflows, then generate a blog post draft.
- 📤 Output can be sent to your preferred platform (Google Docs, Notion, etc.).
